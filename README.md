## Description

It is a game in which the user has to click as many unique cards consecutively as possible. If any card is clicked more than twice, they lose and start over. Card order is shuffled after every click. The character images and corresponding names were fetched from a Disney API (https://disneyapi.dev/).

## Why?

This project's aim was to gain more comfort in using what I learned about React and APIs. I specifically focused on practicing with react components, passing data between components, working with state, and side effects.
