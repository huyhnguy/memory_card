Lion King Memory Game

This project's aim was to gain more comfort in using what I learned about React and APIs. The character images and corresponding names were fetched from a Disney API (https://disneyapi.dev/)

It is a game in which the user has to click as many unique cards consecutively as possible. If any card is clicked more than twice, they lose and start over. Card order is shuffled after every click.
